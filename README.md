# **The Absurd System**
My first attempt at a game i'm already losing interest... Lol maybe I'll fix it probably not.

**The Absurd System** is a humorous, browser-based card strategy game where you tackle bureaucratic chaos, hamster-powered economies, and creativity bans—one absurd scenario at a time. Use your **Innovation Cards**—Logic, Tech, Diplomatic, and Creative—to solve quirky challenges, animate citizens, and restore order in a world where paperwork and red tape reign supreme.

* **Four Absurd Scenarios:**

  1. **The Beige Bureaucracy** – Conquer mountains of paperwork.
  2. **The Hamster Economy** – Harness hamster power to run factories.
  3. **Ministry of Red Tape** – Organize chaotic bureaucrats and pigeons.
  4. **Colorless Creativity Ban** – Bring color back to a muted city.

* **Interactive Fun:** Click on challenge icons, play cards, and watch your actions animate in a minimalist, cartoonish style.

* **Clean & Visual Design:** Designed for browser-based HTML/JS gameplay with smooth animations, tooltips, and pop-up feedback.

**Play, strategize, and laugh as you navigate the absurdities of The Absurd System!**
