# **The Absurd System**

**You are The Splicer** — an eccentric genius who sees “absurdity” where the world sees chaos. In a society strangled by paperwork, hamster-powered economies, and bans on color, you are a one-person innovation agency. Your motto:

**“If it’s stupid, fix it with something even more creative.”**

Use your **Innovation Cards**—Logic, Tech, Diplomatic, and Creative—to tackle four of the world’s most broken systems. Outsmart the chaos, animate citizens, and restore order in the quirkiest ways imaginable.

## **Four Absurd Scenarios**

1. **The Beige Bureaucracy** 🏢
   Mountains of paperwork? Endless forms? Your mission: untangle the red tape and transform a stagnant office into a playground of chaotic productivity.

2. **The Hamster Economy** 🐹
   Hamsters run the factories, and the world runs on their wheels. Your job: negotiate, innovate, and throw a hamster party the economy will never forget.

3. **Ministry of Red Tape** ✂️
   The ultimate fortress of bureaucracy. Infiltrate the “Paper Tower” and cut through rules, forms, and inefficiency—literally and figuratively.

4. **Colorless Creativity Ban** 🎨
   A city without color. A world without joy. Your task: splash creativity back into life and prove that expression isn’t a luxury—it’s survival.
